    'A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$ if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$'\\

        \item[2002] Torch first release (open source library)
        \item[2006] Geoffrey Hinton coins 'Deep Learning'~\cite{Hinton2006}
        \item[>2006] Companies such as Netflix, Facebook, Microsoft, Google fund projects/prizes in and use machine learning/artificial intelligence

\subsection{Workflow}
\label{subsec:introduction-workflow}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
    Machine learning techniques follow a similar workflow.
    \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
        \item Define Problem (scope, feasability)
        \item Gather Data (assumptions, constraints)
        \item Pre-process Data (cleanup, drop)
        \item Analyze Data (define features, find correlations)
        \item Prepare Data (transform, normalize, drop)
        \item Evaluate Models (train/test, classify/regress)
        \item Tune Model (cross validation, fine tune parameters)
        \item Apply model to problems, learn more
    \end{enumerate}
