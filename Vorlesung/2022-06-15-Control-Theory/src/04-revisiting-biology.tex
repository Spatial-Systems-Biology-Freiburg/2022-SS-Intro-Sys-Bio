    "We argue that the key properties of biochemical networks should be robust in order to ensure their proper functioning." - N. Barkai~\cite{Barkai1997}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item These findings were simple integral control feedback loop.
        \item Robustness results from systems controlling themselves
        \item Feedback loops and control mechanisms are unavoidable in modern biology
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Noise can play important role in de-/stabilizing systems
        \item Almost all biological systems are non-linear (eg. Toggle-Switch) $\rightarrow$ some control-schemes do not work as well
        \item When is control of a system optimal? $\rightarrow$ Can it be optimal?
    \end{itemize}
